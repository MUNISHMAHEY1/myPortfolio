                        I am a Coder? Wow that feels amazing and it is more amazing to hear it from someone else. <br></br><br></br>

                        Well here is my journey, I had a normal childhood nothing too special then one day in 9th grade Java was introduced. 
                        My reaction was what are these syntax and curly braces. Never knew I would be fan of these one day. 
                        As a kid, I thought computer was just clicking and gaming (I love gaming BTW). 
                        But the idea that a few line written with some crazy syntax can make a machine do anything blew my mind. 
                        I made up my mind that I want to learn how to code. It definitely was no an easy road to take.<br></br><br></br>

                        As decided, I went to complete my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. 
                        I started working towards developing front-end web pages. 
                        It interested me how a responsive web page can shrink to mobile screen size and still look beautiful. 
                        There was always a question in my mind about mobile applications. How are these mobile applications built? 
                        One fine day, while looking for an answer to this question, I landed on an android development tutorial. 
                        This lead to another chapter of my story. 
                        This chapter is about my fascination about mobile applications and building them. 
                        Due to this, I successfully completed an internship working to build and maintain android applications. 
                        I was somehow not satisfied and happy with myself, I wanted to learn more and explore more so 
                        I decided to enroll for Master's Degree.<br></br><br></br>

                        I never knew this chapter of my life would be introducing me to a whole new world of technologies. 
                        I figured my passion was to build new websites doesn't matter which technology I use. 
                        Python and with Django framework became my love so, I worked on a few academic project using these technologies. 
                        I could not stay away from javaScript as no Web developer would ever do. 
                        I went to build new projects using JavaScript and React.<br></br><br></br>

                        To sum it up, My specialties include quickly learning new programming languages and developer responsive websites. 
                        lways open to challenges as it helps in growth of a person. Excellent Interpersonal and Problem solving Skills. 
                        Technologies under my belt are Python, JavaScript ES6, Reactjs, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Express, Django, Nodejs, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo, JSON and Git. <br></br><br></br>
